                <h3>Amsterdam</h3>
                <p >
                    Amsterdam is the capital city of The Netherlands. It is located in the province Noord-Holland, which is only 1 0 of the 12. 
                    Amsterdam is probably most known for it’s beautiful canals or interesting architecture. Not to forget the large amount of windmills, huge tulip fields, funny clogs as footwear, the variations of cheeses that are available and actually how they handle laws on certain matters.
                    Amsterdam might be a small city, but it is certainly never quiet there. There’s always something to do in this place. You can go visit one of the many stores, go on a sightseeing trip per boat or try to make a decision on where to eat (spoiler alert: it’s not going to be an easy). 
                    The options are endless in this city and I highly recommend to visit this city at least once in your life.
                    Fun fact: the number of different nationalities living together in the town is among the highest in the world.
